# Python Automation Toolkit (Proof-of-Concept)

A simple tool made using Python (pandas, openpyxl, and tkinter).

It adds a "Total" column based on the "Quanity" and "Unit Price" columns in the selected Excel File. (Please see and use the provided ```sales_data.xlsx``` for best results)

## Instructions

Either download the pre-release .exe and use that. It does the same as what is in ```generate_summary.py```

### OR

If you want to run the python scripts themselves:

1. Make sure you have ```python, pandas, tkinter, and openpyxl``` installed on your machine. 
2. Place ```sales_data.xlsx``` and one (or all) of the 3 ```.py``` files in the same folder. 
3. Open a terminal to that folder and run ```python (name of .py file)```

So for example, I would run ```python format_summary.py``` if I wanted to run that python file.
